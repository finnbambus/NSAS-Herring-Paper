The folder R contains all the R code used in this project. The main ides
for the functionality and approach where taken from the paper [“Regime
shift dynamics, tipping points and the success of fisheries management”
by Blöcker et al. 2023](doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-27104-y) which code
is available under
<https://github.com/HeleneGutte/tipping_northsea_fish/tree/main>.

-   **data\_cleanup** contains the R code to import and clean all
    necessary data from the “data raw” folder. The imported Data is
    saved to the “data” folder in the .Rdata format. In addition, Plots
    for a first glance and evaluation of the data are generated and
    saved to the “plots” folder.

    -   Use: Import raw data, save clean data & generate first plots.
    -   Variants: \_component the same analysis on the component level

-   **data\_analysis** contains the R code to analyse the data for
    regimes shifts, it imports its data from “data” and uses functions
    of the “functions” file.

    -   Use: Import and analyse data for regmie-shifts

-   **functions** contains the definition of various functions to
    cluttered the main code files.

    -   use: defines functions used in “data\_cleanup” &
        “data\_analysis”

-   **model\_comp\_functions** contains the functions used to compare
    and fit different models and return corresponding AIC and RSME.

-   **map\_component** contains the code to compile a bathymetric map of
    the North Sea including the areas of each component.
